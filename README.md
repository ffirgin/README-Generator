# README Generator
[Generating Example README recording](https://app.castify.com/view/93c084c3-ce83-4ac5-b76f-6ad451ff3df3)

## Description

This project is a README Generator that requires users to use a terminal environment within an IDE, or Git Bash to answer a few simple questions to generate professional README files.

## Installation

To use this code, clone the code from the Repo using HTTPS. Once cloned onto your local environment, run `npm install` to install inquirer node modules. You can then generate your README by using `node index.js` to initialize the questions.

## Usage

After initializing the questions, you'll be prompted to fill out some general information for your README file. After gathering all the information from the questions, it will generate a markdown file for you.

## Credits

Thanks to Andrei Skorodumov(fellow bootcamper) for assisting with errors that were occurring because I forgot to add a catch for errors.
